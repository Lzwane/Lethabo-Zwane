      <h2>World Oral Day</h2>
      <h5> March 20, 2024</h5>
      <div class="HART2" style="height: 400px;" ></div>
      <p>The School of Dentistry at Sefako Makgatho Health Science
        s University will celebrate World Oral Health Day on March 20, 
        2024, with the theme "A Happy mouth is A Happy body". The purpose is to raise
         awareness that prioritizing oral health leads to better overall health, and to
          educate people on preventing oral diseases and maintaining good oral health. Poor oral health is 
          linked to serious medical conditions like pneumonia, heart disease, and pregnancy complications. To improve oral 
          health, the school encourages everyone to follow simple rules: take care of your mouth daily, eat a healthy diet,
           avoid tobacco, brush and clean your teeth regularly, and visit a registered oral health practitioner twice a year.
            By doing so, oral diseases like dental caries,
         periodontal diseases, and tooth loss can be prevented, ensuring a beautiful smile and overall good health.</p>

          Here is a shortened version of the text:

          The School of Dentistry is addressing the impact of a recent gas leak/disruption in the dental laboratories and clinical areas.
           After consultation, it was determined that the gas line is irreparable and unsafe. To minimize disruption to the academic year, 
           the Academic Planning Committee has implemented the following measures:<br></br>
          
          - Adjusted academic timetable for affected groups (BDS 2 & 3) to continue practical training at an off-site facility<br>
          - Transportation will be provided and a travel roster will be drawn up<br>
          - Interim arrangements for BDS 4 & 5 to use shareable handpieces<br>
          - Timetable adjustments will be communicated through HODs, DSC, and Class representatives<br>
          - Students should continue with scheduled academic sessions<br>
          
          The School is working to find a long-term solution to replace the damaged gas line.
